üìë Report

The project focused on analyzing sales data using Excel with the following key steps:

Pivot Tables were used to extract meaningful insights, such as month-wise order trends, gender-based shopping comparisons (men vs women), and top 5 states with the highest orders.

Dashboard Creation:
